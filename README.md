# textformattingsuite_cpp
a text formatting suite made in cpp using oop.

The Text Formatting Suite as it is called above, is a collection of ten independently designed modules distributed between the project group members and compiled in a single file at the end. The different modules help in different aspects of text formatting.
The program doesnt have any graphics and is platform independant, meaning it can be used on any operating system as long as it has a c++ compiler to run the code.

the basic functionality includes reading input from a user-defined file, performing the user-defined operation on it, and then saving the output in another user-defined output file.
